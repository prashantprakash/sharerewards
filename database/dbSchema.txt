Requests
request_id | cust_id | reward_amt | request_status | request_date | return_date | bid_cust_id | bid_reward_amt | bit_days | bid_return_amt

	- request_id -- pKey, auto incr
	- cust_id -- cust_id who has request for loan
	- reward_amt -- reward points, a customer wants to loan
	- request_status -- one of the many statuses [Pending, x bids(bidding started), Reward Loaned(bid approved),Reward Returned, Reward Overdue]
	- request_date -- date the request was generated
*	- return_date -- decided based on the bid_days and current date
*	- bid_cust_id -- The customer whose bid has been accepted
*	- bid_reward_amt -- return amnt decided by the bidder
*	- bit_days -- days decided by the user
**	- bid_return_amt -- return amnt might differ from bid_reward_amt, if the cust fails to return before say 120 days!

* These fields are copied into the table from, BIDS table, when the request_status is changed to 'Reward Loaned'. Now the rows for this request id can be deleted from the BIDS table
** This will be same as bid_reward_amt until return_data. Then some penalty will be applied, say 100pts/day.
